# ABM-SIR
## Files in this repository are:
1. SIR Model: This folder includes the Jupyter notebook used for solving the SIR differential equations model and used for fitting the Gaussians to infection curves from both the differential equations model and the agent based model. This folder also contains csv files from differing trials.
2. Speed Trials: This folder has csv files for each of the Gaussians fit to the different speed trials' infection curves that were averaged.
3. 50 trials speed 1-1infected: This csv is contains fifty trials and the Gaussians fit to the infection curve of these trials. These trials were all done for initial parameters and with the speed not set to be variable yet.
4. Collisions.nlogo.zip: This is the NetLogo model used to empirically find the number of encounters/tick in the agent based model.
5. Disease pop 100000.nlogo.zip: This is the NetLogo model used replicate the susceptible infected recovered model of disease spread.
6. Encounter:Tick Data.csv: This is the csv of the encounters per tick data used to emprically find this ratio and set the ticks per days ratio.
7. Gaussian Characters.csv: This is a summary of all models tested and the characteristics or resulting parameters of the Gaussians fit to their infection curves.
